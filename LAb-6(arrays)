# 📘 Array Scripts Overview

This file explains the idea behind **three array operations**:

---

## 🔹 1. Using `for` Loop
➡️ Iterates through the array step by step using an index. Best when you clearly know the start and end.

## 🔹 2. Using `while` Loop + Length
➡️ Uses a counter variable along with the array’s length to move through elements until the condition fails.

## 🔹 3. Array Slicing
➡️ Extracts a specific portion of the array based on given start and end positions, without changing the original array.

## 🔹 4. Nested Loop With Two Arrays️️ 

### ➡️ oops over two arrays (names and age) using nested for loops.

### ➡️ Each element of one array is paired with elements of the other.

### ➡️ Useful when working with multiple lists and combining their values.
