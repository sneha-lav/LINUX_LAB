Here's a Markdown (`.md`) file that explains the `cp`, `mv`, and `touch` commands, along with an example demonstrating moving a file from one location to another.

# Linux File Commands: `cp`, `mv`, `touch`

This document explains three basic Linux commands used to manage files: `cp`, `mv`, and `touch`, with examples.

---

## üìù 1. `touch` Command

**Usage:**  
`touch` is used to create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.

**Syntax:**
```bash
touch filename
````

**Example:**

```bash
touch file1.txt
```

This command creates an empty file named `file1.txt` in the current directory.

---

## üìã 2. `cp` Command

**Usage:**
`cp` is used to copy files or directories.

**Syntax:**

```bash
cp source_file destination_file
```

**Example:**

```bash
cp file1.txt copy_file1.txt
```

This creates a copy of `file1.txt` named `copy_file1.txt` in the same directory.

---

## üîÄ 3. `mv` Command

**Usage:**
`mv` is used to move or rename files or directories.

**Syntax:**

```bash
mv source_file destination_path
```

**Example: Move File to Another Directory:**

```bash
mv file1.txt Documents/
```

This command moves `file1.txt` into the `Documents` folder.

If `Documents/` doesn‚Äôt exist, it will rename `file1.txt` to `Documents`.

**Example: Rename a File:**

```bash
mv file1.txt renamed_file.txt
```

This command renames `file1.txt` to `renamed_file.txt`.

---

## üì¶ Combined Example: Creating, Copying, and Moving a File

```bash
touch notes.txt           # Create an empty file
cp notes.txt backup.txt   # Make a copy of the file
mkdir archive             # Create a new directory named 'archive'
mv backup.txt archive/    # Move 'backup.txt' to the 'archive' folder
```

After running these commands:

* `notes.txt` remains in the current directory.
* `backup.txt` is now inside the `archive/` directory.
